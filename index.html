          <h3>Building Custom Computers</h3>
          <p class="build-text">
            One of my biggest passions since i was a kid was the Software along with the Hardware of a computer, and by the time that i grew up i started building custom computers that were studied,  built and configured by myself.

          <h3>Gaming</h3>
          <p class="gaming-text">
            Besides the passion for building and configuring custom PCs, the thing that made come into the tech world has alway been Gaming.
            I've been playing VideoGames since i was 4-5 years old and since then i've never got tired of it.
            My first ever PC that i used to play VideoGames with was a computer with Windows98 and an old Intel Pentium and i used to love playing Age Of Empires on it, in general it worked quite well,
            after that i've played with a bunch of consoles too like Playstation 1, Xbox360 and Nintendo Wii, etc.
            But my favorite game station will alway be my custom PC❤️
